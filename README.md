SPSS file contains variable labels for clarification. Excel file has two sheets: variable_labels explains each variable, the second sheet contains the data.

Attractiveness ratings for faces occluded with masks or notebooks and faces not covered with anything appear in the beginning of the table, labeled, e.g., " attractiveness.rating.full_face.low_attract" where the first part refers to the variable (attractiveness rating), the second part specifies if the face is occluded or not, the third part refers to base attractiveness (low, medium, high). 

Occlusion denotes if masks or notebooks were used to cover the faces.
Race refers to the race of the presented faces.

FAC1_1 shows participants' component score on the PCA component. FAC1_median.split is the dichotomized FAC1_1, where 0 = anti-mask views, 1 = pro-mask views.
This is the essential data on which the analyses reported in the paper are based. After these you can find raw participants' answers to the survey questions.
